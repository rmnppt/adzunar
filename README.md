# adzunar [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rmnppt/adzunar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rmnppt/adzunar)

Some wrappers to provide an R interface for the Adzuna API.

This is currently under development but you can install it with `devtools::install_github("rmnppt/adzunar")`.

There is currently only one function, once the package is installed type `library(adzunar)` and `?get_country_page` to get the documentation for that function.
